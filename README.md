# BAmazon /'bēˈaməzən/

BAmazon is a CLI storefront designed with JavaScript and Node with the help of MySQL to store all data.  
Running the app you will be prompted to select one of the listed items by its unique ID and specify how many of that item you want to purchase. Input validation will only allow you to input numbers.
Before you start, install the below packages and don't forget to "*npm i*". Have fun:)

**Packages used:**
- Inquirer
- MySQL
